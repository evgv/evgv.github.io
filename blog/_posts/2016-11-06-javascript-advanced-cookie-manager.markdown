Hi, 

I want to represent my small client-side javascript library that makes managing cookies easy and that I call `Acm` or `Advanced cookie manager`.

It is a lightweight(compressed less then 3 kb), cross-browser(support all modern browsers) script which hasn't any dependencies and written on pure javascript.

P.S.
_I will be very grateful to anybody who is give me feedback about my script or some ideas how to improve it._
